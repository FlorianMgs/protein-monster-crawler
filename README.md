# Installation
Make sure you have python installed.  
Then, create a `venv`, activate it and install requirements.  
Now you're good to go!

This can be used with almost any ARG websites as soon as urls are public. 
Just replace `start_url = "https://protein.monster"` by whatever.

Launch the script with:  
`python main.py`
